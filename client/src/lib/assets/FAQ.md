## What is this?

This is a allfeat-testnet faucet. You can use this to load testnet tokens into your account.

## What is a faucet?

A faucet is a developer tool to get a small amount of testnet tokens (<NETWORK-TOKEN>) in order to test and troubleshoot a decentralized application or protocol before going live on Allfeat, where one must use real AFT.

Most faucets require social authentication (e.g. Twitter post or login confirming you are a real human) or place you in a queue to wait for a testnet token through the faucet. The Allfeat faucet is free, fast, and does not require authentication.

## How do I use this?

To request funds, simply enter your <NETWORK-NAME> wallet address, fill the captcha, and hit "Submit".

## How much <NETWORK-TOKEN> will I receive?

You will receive 1 <NETWORK-TOKEN> per request.

## How often can I request tokens?

You can request tokens every 24h! If you request <NETWORK-TOKEN> for one account, you can't request more for another chain in that period.

## What is a testnet token?

Testnet tokens are a test currency that allows you to test your Allfeat application before going live. Testnet tokens can be used in place of real tokens on testnets like <NETWORK-NAME>.

## Can I get real AFTs?

No, we will provide you with TEST SPIs (Equivalent of AFT for symphonie testnet), so you can do your testing and move it to mainnet whenever you are ready
